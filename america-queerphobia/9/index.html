                If these two laws are passed, it can only lead to more laws like them coming in the future, and while people are finally catching on to the negative effects of transphobia and homophobia, some very stubborn people are trying very hard to make things even worse. America likes to pretend that they’re a land where everyone has equal opportunities to express themselves and find their own future, but sadly this is a complete lie. If these laws are passed, America will get even further from their fantasy of what they are, and at the end of the day, real people’s lives will be harmed.
