            <p>In the hours before dawn, on June 28th, 1969, New York police raided the Mafia run Stonewall bar in Greenwich Village, New York City, an infamous meeting place for people whose sexuality made them common targets out in the public. What the police didn't expect, however, is that the people in the bar would fight back, in a now legendary act of protest known as the Stonewall Riots, protesting police brutality, and homophobia, sparking a still ongoing movement for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, LGBT, rights.

                Despite this, America is still trying to stop queer people from getting the rights they deserve, but at the end of the day, weâ€™re all people, and being mean to people just because is stupid.
