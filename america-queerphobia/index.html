        <title>American anti-LGBT laws</title>

        <p>In the hours before dawn, on June 28th, 1969, New York police raided the Mafia run Stonewall bar in Greenwich Village, New York City, an infamous meeting place for people whose sexuality made them common targets out in the public. What the police didn't expect, however, is that the people in the bar would fight back, in a now legendary act of protest known as the Stonewall Riots, protesting police brutality, and homophobia, sparking a still ongoing movement for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.

            Despite this, America is still trying to stop queer people from getting the rights they deserve, but at the end of the day, we’re all people, and being mean to people just because is stupid.
            
            In 2015, over fifty years after the protest, America legalised gay marriage across every state in the country after a supreme court ruling stating that banning same sex marriage is unconstitutional, and so, the future of LGBT people started to look bright.
            
            In April 2021, the Florida senate put forward a law that banned transgender girls from competing in sports beyond secondary school level unless their testosterone level matched that which was required for OLYMPIC ATHLETES, and requiring people suspected of being trans to have their GENITALS EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THEIR SEX. The Florida senate quickly removed… that part, but two months later, the bill passed. In fact, 2021 was the worst year on record for anti-trans laws in America.
            
            Five months later, in September, Texas placed a blanket ban on any abortions being done, even if the pregnacy was caused by sexual assualt, was in a teenager, or if the birth could go as far as to cause the mother to die. 
            
            And now, in 2022, both states have attempted to pass laws that will cause the lives of LGBTQ people, especially transgender children, to be far worse. A new law in Texas has been placed that makes gender affirming healthcare for transgender children child abuse, and if a parent is seen helping their child transition, the medical center that provides the healthcare must be reported to the state authorities. 
            
            Very often when a discussion on trans rights happens, someone is quick to bring up one number, 41%. This number is the percentage of transgender children who have attempted to commit suicide. Often this number has been used to make it appear as if trans people are deranged and commit suicide because of it, but this is not true. In fact, the same study where this number originates clearly shows that this rate heavily decreases if one is given access to gender affirming care, and is supported and treated as a human. It’s important to remember that this number is not a “number” as such, it’s a group of real people who have attempted to take their own life because of the way they have been treated by society, and if this law in Texas were to pass, then even more real people die by taking their own life.
            
            As well, a law was recently put forward in Florida, which is now known as the “Don’t Say Gay Bill”. This law presents itself as a way to give parents more freedom over the education of their children, but there is one important detail slipped in, in schools for children under third grade, no discussion of “adult activities” (i.e, sexual orientation and gender identity) would be allowed in schools (Also the bill said that schools can’t intervene with what parents are doing to their children which is… not great). Supporters of the bill have said things along the lines of “THINK OF THE CHILDREN! THEY CAN’T LEARN THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT TO THEM, OR THAT THEY THEMSELVES COULD BE DIFFERENT! IT’S TOO INAPPROPRIATE!” I’m sorry, but how is learning that some men love men and some women love women too much for kids to handle? How is that inappropriate?
            
            As you can probably guess, LGBT activists were, let’s just say unhappy about this, causing a couple major protests, such as students walking out of schools showing signs in support of LGBT rights, and employees of Disney protesting the law and Disney themselves for removing a same sex couple from one of their upcoming movies. 
            
            It’s a sadly common story with LGBTQ+ people, in schools they aren’t allowed to figure out for themselves who they truly are, and often think that there’s something wrong with them, or that no-one will accept them if they do end up coming out as who they truly are, which, going back to what I wrote before, can depressingly often lead to them taking their own lives. 
            
            If passed, the Don’t Say Gay bill will stop queer children from figuring out who they are, leading to them taking their own lives. While this bill only affects young children, it puts forward a path that leads to LGBTQ people of any age not having any way of discovering themselves, which is ultimately incredibly harmful.
            
            If these two laws are passed, it can only lead to more laws like them coming in the future, and while people are finally catching on to the negative effects of transphobia and homophobia, some very stubborn people are trying very hard to make things even worse. America likes to pretend that they’re a land where everyone has equal opportunities to express themselves and find their own future, but sadly this is a complete lie. If these laws are passed, America will get even further from their fantasy of what they are, and at the end of the day, real people’s lives will be harmed.
