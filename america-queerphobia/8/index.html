                It’s a sadly common story with LGBTQ+ people. In schools they aren’t allowed to figure out for themselves who they truly are, and often think that there’s something wrong with them, or that no-one will accept them if they do end up coming out as who they truly are, which, going back to what I wrote before, can depressingly often lead to them taking their own lives. 
                
                If passed, the Don’t Say Gay bill will stop queer children from figuring out who they are, leading to them taking their own lives. While this bill may only affect young children, it puts forward a path that leads to LGBTQ people of any age not having any way of discovering themselves, which is ultimately incredibly harmful.
