                As well, a law was recently put forward in Florida, known as the “Don’t Say Gay Bill”. This law presents itself as a way to give parents more freedom over the education of their children, but there is one important detail slipped in, in schools for children under third grade, no discussion of what the law describes as “adult activities” (i.e, sexual orientation and gender identity) would be allowed in schools (Also the bill said that schools can’t intervene with what parents are doing to their children which is a whole other thing that is also very bad). Supporters of the bill, such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have said things along the lines of “THINK OF THE CHILDREN! THEY CAN’T LEARN THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT TO THEM, OR THAT THEY THEMSELVES COULD BE DIFFERENT! WE CAN'T INJECT "TRANSGENDERISM" INTO SCHOOL! IT’S TOO INAPPROPRIATE!” 
                <span style="font-size: 50%;">I’m sorry, but how is learning that some men love men and some women love women too much for kids to handle? How is that inappropriate?</span>
