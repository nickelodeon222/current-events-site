                Very often when a discussion on trans rights happens, someone is quick to bring up one number, 41%. This number is the percentage of transgender children who have attempted to commit suicide. Often this number has been used to make it appear as if trans people are deranged and commit suicide because of it, but this is not true. In fact, the same study where this number originates clearly shows that this rate heavily decreases if one is given access to gender affirming care, and is supported and treated as a human. It’s important to remember that this number is not a “number” as such, it’s a group of real people who have attempted to take their own life because of the way they have been treated by society, and if this law in Texas were to pass, then even more real people die by taking their own life.
