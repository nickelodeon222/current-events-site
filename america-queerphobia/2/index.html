                In 2015, over fifty years after the protest, America legalised gay marriage across every state in the country after a supreme court ruling stating that banning same sex marriage is unconstitutional, and so, the future of LGBT people started to look bright.

                <span class="tab"></span>In April 2021, the Florida senate put forward a law that banned transgender girls from competing in sports beyond secondary school level unless their testosterone level matched that which was required for <span class="bold italic">OLYMPIC ATHLETES</span>, and requiring people suspected of being trans to have their <span class="bold italic">GENITALS EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THEIR SEX</span>. The Florida senate quickly removedâ€¦ that part, but two months later, the bill passed. In fact, 2021 was the worst year on record for anti-trans laws in America.
